1. Introduction
The Food Donation and Distribution Management System (FDDMS) is a web application designed to connect donors, distribution centers, recipients, and employees in a collaborative network for efficient food donation and distribution management. With the primary goal of reducing food waste and addressing food insecurity, the FDDMS offers a structured way for organizations to manage surplus food donations, ensuring that edible food reaches those in need in a timely manner.
This project is built using React for the frontend to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience, Spring Boot as the backend framework to handle the core logic and API interactions, and MySQL for a reliable database solution to store and manage data. By integrating these technologies, FDDMS ensures a seamless experience across multiple devices, enabling users to access the platform from desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.
The system operates through four main user types:
•	Donors: Individuals or organizations that register and donate surplus food items.
•	Distribution Centers: Local centers or facilities that receive and store food items, preparing them for distribution to recipients.
•	Recipients: Individuals or families who request and receive food aid through the system.
•	Employees: Volunteers or organization members who help manage donations, inventory, and logistics.
Key features of FDDMS include:
1.	Real-Time Donation Tracking: Donors can log food items, specify quantities, and provide expiration details, allowing distribution centers to monitor donations as they are received.
2.	Inventory Management: The system tracks food items in storage, noting expiration dates and managing available inventory to ensure items are distributed before spoilage.
3.	Recipient Requests and Distribution: Recipients can make requests for food items, and the system helps match available inventory with requests. Employees coordinate delivery or pickup, depending on the needs of the recipient.
4.	Transparency and Reporting: The platform provides data on donations, distributions, and inventory, generating regular reports to help stakeholders monitor the impact and effectiveness of the system.
The FDDMS aims to make food donation processes more transparent, organized, and accessible, fostering a sustainable approach to food distribution by reducing waste and addressing hunger. By empowering community members and organizations to collaborate on a single platform, this system creates a positive social impact, contributing to a healthier and more resilient community.
2. Abstract
The Food Donation and Distribution Management System (FDDMS) is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of food donation, storage, and distribution, specifically targeting the issue of food insecurity. This project addresses two significant challenges: food waste and hunger. Built with React on the frontend, Spring Boot for backend processing, and MySQL for data management, FDDMS brings together donors, distribution centers, recipients, and employees on a single platform.
The system allows donors—such as individuals, organizations, or NGOs—to log and manage food donations by providing details about food type, quantity, and expiration. Distribution centers receive these donations and handle inventory management, ensuring that food items are stored and tracked until they reach the recipients. Recipients, who are individuals or families in need, can request food items, while employees (volunteers or staff) facilitate the collection, processing, and distribution of these donations.
Key features of FDDMS include real-time tracking of donations, inventory management, request processing, and transparency through detailed reporting tools. The platform aims to minimize food wastage by ensuring food is distributed before expiration, while also improving food accessibility for vulnerable populations. The FDDMS fosters community engagement and responsible consumption by reducing the gap between food surplus and need. Its design promotes ease of use, accountability, and scalability, making it adaptable for local, regional, and national food aid efforts.
The FDDMS contributes positively to both environmental sustainability and social welfare, aligning with the goals of reducing food waste and addressing hunger. This report outlines the system's requirements, structure, and functionality, detailing the design considerations, non-functional requirements, and anticipated impact of the platform on community-driven food donation initiatives.

6. Conclusion
The development of the Food Donation and Distribution Management System (FDDMS) has provided a comprehensive solution to address food insecurity and reduce food wastage by creating a bridge between donors and recipients. This project enabled us to apply our engineering knowledge and technical skills to solve a real-world problem, reinforcing the importance of technology in promoting social welfare and environmental sustainability.
Through the design and implementation of FDDMS, we effectively tackled the challenges associated with food donation management, such as tracking donations, ensuring data privacy, and providing a user-friendly interface for diverse stakeholders. The system’s functionalities, including donor registration, inventory management, and distribution coordination, were crafted with an emphasis on security, efficiency, and scalability. By focusing on these aspects, we developed a platform that is both impactful and adaptable, capable of serving different communities and regions.
This project also facilitated learning and growth beyond technical skills. It required us to understand ethical considerations, work in a multidisciplinary team, and communicate effectively with various stakeholders. These experiences have enriched our understanding of the societal impact of engineering and reinforced our commitment to lifelong learning. Moreover, FDDMS aligns with global sustainability goals by mitigating food waste and promoting resource redistribution, which are essential in addressing environmental and social challenges.
In conclusion, the FDDMS project is a testament to the role of technology in addressing pressing societal issues. By fostering a culture of giving and promoting efficient resource management, this project not only contributes to the well-being of underprivileged communities but also exemplifies the meaningful contributions engineers can make to society. Moving forward, we believe that FDDMS has the potential to expand and evolve, incorporating new features and reaching broader audiences, thereby making a lasting impact on food security and sustainability.
