1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Food Donation and Distribution Management System (FDDMS) is designed to simplify and 
manage the operations of food aid organizations, handling donations, and distribution to recipients 
in need. This SRS outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, defining its 
scope, interfaces, and operational context.
1.2 Document Conventions
Standard typographical conventions are followed. Priorities are denoted as follows:
High: Critical features.
Medium: Necessary but non-critical features.
Low: Optional or future features.
1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for:
Developers: To understand system requirements.
Project Managers: For project planning and management.
Testers: To create test cases.
End Users: To ensure the system meets their needs.
1.4 Product Scope
The FDDMS will assist food aid organizations in managing the entire process from food donation to 
distribution. The system's key goals are to:
Track food donations from individuals and organizations.
Coordinate the distribution of food items to recipients.
Provide performance tracking and accountability.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The Food Donation and Distribution Management System (FDDMS) is a socially impactful platform 
designed to foster community engagement and reduce food waste. By connecting donors, 
distribution centres, and recipients in a unified, transparent system, FDDMS promotes fair and 
efficient resource allocation. This system not only addresses the issue of hunger but also contributes 
to environmental sustainability by reducing food waste. It empowers communities to come together 
and support those in need, encouraging a culture of giving and responsible consumption. Through its 
efficient tracking and management, FDDMS strengthens local food networks and fosters a sense of 
unity and mutual support, ultimately helping communities grow stronger and more resilient.
2.2 Product Functions
Donation Management: Record and manage food donations.
Recipient Management: Manage the list of recipients and their needs.
Distribution Management: Track food distribution activities.
Reporting: Generate reports on donations and distributions for accountability.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Donors: NGOs, individuals, and organizations contributing food.
Administrators: System managers at distribution centres.
Recipients: Needy individuals or families receiving food.
Volunteers: Staff involved in the distribution process.
2.4 Operating Environment
Platform: Web-based application.
Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, macOS.
Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
Data security for sensitive recipient information.
Compliance with local regulations for food safety and distribution.
2.6 User Documentation
The system will include a user manual, online help, and tutorials.
2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumes internet access for cloud-based operation.
Dependency on third-party systems for donor and recipient verification.
3. External Interface Requirements
3.1 User Interfaces
Web-based UI for administrators and donors.
Simple, mobile-friendly interface for volunteers and recipients.
3.2 Hardware Interfaces
No direct hardware interfaces are required. The system operates on standard web infrastructure, 
accessible via browsers on various devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. 
Future iterations may consider integration with hardware devices such as barcode scanners or IoT 
sensors for inventory tracking and management, depending on the evolving needs of the system.
3.3 Software Interfaces
Integration with third-party donor and recipient verification systems.
3.4 Communications Interfaces
Email notifications for donations and distributions.
API for integration with other organizational systems.
4. System Features
4.1 Donation Management
4.1.1 Description and Priority
The system must enable users to log, manage, and track food donations from NGOs and individuals. 
Priority: High
4.1.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
Donor logs a donation → System records and provides confirmation.
Donation reaches a threshold → System notifies distribution centres.
4.1.3 Functional Requirements
REQ-1: The system shall allow users to input donation details, including food type, quantity, and 
donor information.
REQ-2: The system shall store donation history for future reference.
4.2 Distribution Management
4.2.1 Description and Priority
The system must manage the distribution of food to recipients and track inventory at distribution 
centres. Priority: High
4.2.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
Administrator schedules a distribution → System allocates food from inventory.
4.2.3 Functional Requirements
REQ-3: The system shall allow distribution centres to record and schedule food distributions.
REQ-4: The system shall track inventory levels and notify users when stock is low.
4.3 Reporting and Accountability
4.3.1 Description and Priority
The system must provide reporting tools for tracking donations and distributions, ensuring 
transparency. Priority: Medium
4.3.2 Stimulus/Response Sequences
User requests a report → System generates a summary of activities.
4.3.3 Functional Requirements
REQ-5: The system shall generate reports on donation amounts and distribution activities.
REQ-6: The system shall provide filters for generating custom reports.
5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements
5.1 Performance Requirements
The system must support up to 1,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds 
for most operations.
5.2 Safety Requirements
The system should ensure no food safety hazards occur due to incorrect tracking of food expiration 
dates.
5.3 Security Requirements
The system shall encrypt all sensitive data, including donor and recipient information, both in transit 
and at rest.
5.4 Software Quality Attributes
Usability: The system must be easy to use for users with minimal technical skills.
Reliability: System uptime of 99.9% is required.
